Hi!  I'm the Blockman!

It looks like this is your first time playing the game, so I'll fill you in real quick on how to play.  If you don't need to hear this, just press F1 and I'll stop talking.

To move me around, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys on your keyboard.  I'll automatically climb over obstacles one block high, but I can't jump any higher than that.  My legs *are* pretty short...

To make me pick up a block, push the UP key, and I'll set it down again when you push the DOWN key.

That's it for now.  I'll tell you some more on the next level.  But give that a try so far.

Oh!  I amost forgot!  The goal is to get me to that door over there.  Ha, thanks!
