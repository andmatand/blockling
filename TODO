-Maybe: Holding down shift with arrows makes player walk as far as possible
(without falling off a cliff two blocks high)

-Spinach/other items?

-Figure out a way to avoid the visible hiccup when scrolling to next level with
parallax background

-Add player speech on level 0 of Block-Man 1 levels, explaining what these
levels are and how the controls are different
