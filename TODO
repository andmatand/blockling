-Add timer on/off option
-Move the camera-movement code into a function so it can be called also from the Load Level menu
-Add tab support to DrawText (for control setup menu.  It would look nice if they were aligned better.)
-Maybe: Holding down shift with arrows makes player walk as far as possible
-Spinach/other items?
-Speech
-Save/load settings to a file

==Bugs==
-Undo memory of 1 does not work
