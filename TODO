-Maybe: Holding down shift with arrows makes player walk as far as possible
(without falling off a cliff two blocks high)

-Spinach/other items?

-Replay saving code needs to be rewritten to account for multiple players
(replays do not currently work on levels with > 1 player)

-Make all file errors fail gracefully (i.e. no segfaulting)

-Fix GetTextW() and then use it in DrawBubbles()

-Figure out a way to avoid the visible hiccup when scrolling to next level with
parallax background
