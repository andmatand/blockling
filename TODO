-Maybe: Holding down shift with arrows makes player walk as far as
possible (without falling off a cliff two blocks high)

-Spinach/other items?

-Replay saving code needs to be rewritten to account for multiple
 players (replays do not currently work on levels with > 1 player)

-Make file errors fail gracefully (i.e. no segfaulting)

-Make the program actually read the list in data/tiles/list (instead of
hard coding paths) & add text notice when tileset is changed e.g.
"Tileset: Default" in upper left corner for 1 sec
