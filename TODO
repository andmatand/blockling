-Maybe: Holding down shift with arrows makes player walk as far as
possible (without falling off a cliff two blocks high)

-Spinach/other items?

-Replay saving code needs to be rewritten to account for multiple
 players (replays do not currently work on levels with > 1 player)


==Bugs==
-After a replay, choosing "Change Level" from the pause menu doesn't work
-Teleportation animation lags behind camera movements
-In Windows, controls aren't written to settings file
