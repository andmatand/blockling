I. ABOUT
========
In 1993, Doug and Larry Murk of Soleau Software <www.soleau.com> released
BLOCK-MAN 1.0.  I first played Block-man at my grandmother's house as a young
lad circa 1996.  It was included on one of those demo CDs which had dozens of
Shareware/Demo games on them.  Since Block-man was distributed as "shareware",
it happened to be included on one of those discs.

As I played the game, I was intruiged by its deceitfully simple gameplay;
Little blocks, innocently stacked in random piles amidst a room, radiated with
child-like playfulness, yet the task of arranging them in such a way as to
reach the exit became a trickier puzzle with each level.
