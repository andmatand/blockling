I. ABOUT
========
In 1993, Doug and Larry Murk of Soleau Software <www.soleau.com> released
BLOCK-MAN 1.0.  I first played Block-man at my grandmother's house as a young
lad circa 1996.  It was included on one of those old demo CDs which would have
dozens of Shareware/Demo games on them.  Since Block-man was distributed as
"shareware", it happened to be included on one of those discs.

As I played the game, I was intrigued by its deceitfully simple gameplay;
Little blocks, innocently stacked in random piles amidst a room, radiated with
child-like playfulness; yet, as the levels progressed, the task of arranging
them in such a way as to reach the exit became a puzzle far too complex for
most grown men!

Being an avid QBasic programmer from the age of nine, I figured I'd attempt to
implement my own version of Block-man.  I did so rather succesfully, adding my
own touches such as telepads and the ability to push blocks and turn around
without walking.  These additions gave the game a somewhat different dynamic,
and I was pleased overall with the result, except for one big problem: I had
written the whole thing in QBasic.  Becuase my code was much too large for the
simple QBasic interpreter, not only was I forced to stop adding to it, but I
was unable to compile it into an executable, thus making it impossible to 
distribute to others in any practical way.  Don't use QBasic, folks (not that
anyone does anymore anyway).

Many years later, I discovered Linux (*applause*).
